# Lurker's luck

This simple Firefox extension is intended for anonymous `reddit.com` visitors.

There is an amazing `libredd.it` project that once again gives us freedom to read what people share (and what Google conveniently indexed) without giving our personal data, watching unimaginable amounts of ads, terrible web UX and all these things that you hate.

Please note, that this extension is designed specifically for `reddit.com` and people who prefer not to register there. The advantage over a much better `Redirector` extension is that you do not need to give read-write permissions for **ALL** pages, which I find much, much more acceptable.
